# Hyperbolic-Embedding
Learning neural network embeddings in hyperbolic spaces

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This project uses a custom data reader generate_batch.so to read the random walks. It can be built using the included generate_batch.bat file

cd src/cpp
./generate_batch.bat

The file is written for a mac. On a different OS the dynamic_lookup flag should be removed from generate_batch.bat before executing.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat
